<p>This is a simple implementation of the popular game "Flappy Bird" using the Pygame library in Python. The game involves controlling a bird to navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The bird's movement is controlled by pressing the spacebar to make it flap its wings and avoid falling down due to gravity. The game keeps track of the player's score based on the number of pipes successfully passed. When the bird collides with a pipe or hits the top/bottom boundaries of the screen, the game ends and the player can restart by pressing the spacebar. The code also includes a feature to display the top score achieved.</p>
